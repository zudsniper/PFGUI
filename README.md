# PFGUI
### SUMMARY
PhotoFinder was started as a command line application to recurse a directory and all it's subdirectories to find photos. Now, photoFinder GUI, or PFGUI for short, is a light-weight Java GUI that recurses a directory and all it's subdirectories for the types specified in ones selected filter. (By default, this is `photos.json`)

### SEARCHING
The search capabilities of PFGUI are very customisable. All one must do is create their own filter, (A simple JSON file) and select it within the app. I go into more detail about custom filters [here](../master/filters.md).
